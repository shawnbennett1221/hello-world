# hello-world
my first repository getting started on github.  yay so excited to begin coding

hello im shawn.  I am learning to code and become a data science and analyst due to work related failures.  I need to reinvent my life and learn or relearn Information technology.  This has been a very upsetting 2+ years of my life.  I am 51 years old and need to find a continous way to stay competitive in my life.  Technology is the battle ground these days and age is just a number.  I MUST evolve.  Death is not an option!
